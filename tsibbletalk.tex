\subsection{Tidy temporal data and
workflow}\label{tidy-temporal-data-and-workflow}}

The \CRANpkg{tsibble} package extends the \texttt{data.frame} and
\CRANpkg{tibble} structure to represent temporal data in tidy format
{[}cite{]}. A tsibble consists of \emph{index}, \emph{key}, and other
measured variables in one data frame. The \emph{index} column holds
time-based indices. The \emph{key} column(s) uniquely identifies a
collection of related observational units during a period of time
defined by \emph{index}. They are ``sticky'' columns to a
\texttt{tsibble} over the course of transformation.

The \CRANpkg{feasts} and \CRANpkg{fable} packages, part of the
\textbf{tidyverts} suite, aim to make time series analysis easier. They
provide analytical and forecasting tools for the tsibble data structure,
generating tsibble-centered workflow. Functions, such as
\texttt{features()} and \texttt{model()}, summarise a sequence of
indexed values down to a single statistic or model by every
observational unit. The output is a normal table, where each row
corresponds to an observational unit denoted by ``key''. In the context
of relational databases, the ``key'' acts like a foreign key in a
reduced form of tsibble, while the index and key together operates like
a primary key.

At the early stage of exploratory temporal data analysis, time series
plots and scatterplots goes hand by hand. (insert figures below)

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Symbolic formula to express structural specifications among keyed
  units, using \texttt{/} and \texttt{*} from Wilkinson notation
  (10.2307/2346786) for nesting and crossing.
\item
  Nesting variables generate hierarchical tree, hence
  \texttt{plotly\_key\_tree()}. Overview and navigation made easier.
\item
  One-to-many linking: marking a single point of interest highlights all
  other points that share particular data values (connect-type)
\item
  Lists of key values, and json
\item
  R6 subclass of \texttt{SharedData} from \{crosstalk\}
\end{itemize}

\section{Slicing and dicing time}\label{slicing-and-dicing-time}}

The other critical aspect of a tsibble is ``index'', that provides
foundational temporal context. A common tool in time series analytical
toolkit is seasonal plots that lay time series not on the whole time
scale, but on an origin-less relative time unit, such as
\texttt{gg\_season()} in the \{feasts\} package. It helps to examine and
emphasise periodic/aperiodic patterns, comparing to time series plots
that primarily focus on trends. Standard seasonal plots break the
overall time into two components: seasonal periods on the x-axis, and
grouped by their corresponding lower-resolution time. For example,
monthly data can be decomposed into months separated by years, and
hourly data into hours grouped by days.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Transform and send newly-transformed data via server, without updating
  anything else (e.g.~layout and graphical elements), to avoid
  completely redrawing.
\item
  A shiny module: slider and plot
\end{itemize}
